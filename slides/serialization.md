# Data Serialization

Data serialization is a fundamental protocol requirement for all
applications constructed with an
[indirect access naming model](../slides/parallel-models.md). 

## Problems that require data serialization

- How can we take a data structure that may have memory address
  pointers and convert it to a pointer-free format that is suitable
  for transmission on a network or saving in storage?
  * Because standard memory address pointers are meaningless across
    process, on network, or on disk
- Is it efficient or appropriate to use the same data format in memory
  as on a network or disk?
	
## Commonly-used serialization systems

- JSON (text-based human-readable format most commonly used in Web
  transactions)
- **Protobuf (compact binary format, open-sourced by Google)**
  * Most of this course content assumes protobuf, but it is by no means
    required in gRPC
- Thrift (compact binary format, open-sourced by Facebook as part of
  Apache Thrift and FBThrift)
- Flatbuffers (performance-oriented binary format, open-sourced by
  Google and targeted to game developers)
- Many others
  
## Focus on Protobuf

- Various scalar and structured data objects, plus the ability to
  add user-defined structures
  * An interesting feature is compactness-optimized integers
    where commonly used values such as 0 take only 1 byte but a
    32-bit integer could take up to 5 bytes depending on the value.
- Each object field has a user-defined tag to allow for future expansion
- All fields in a structure are optional and 
  take only minimal space if unused.
